Software configuration management reminds me of a combination of Agile and version control. It is about communication amongst the SCM process roles: configuration manager, developer, auditor, project manager, and user. By following SCM, it can be ensured that no participant is left behind, and all are kept apprised of the current status of the project. Often times a team project, loses efficiency in trying to manage code versions, sprints, and requirements and keep them all organized. If implemented properly, SCM can greatly increase the productivity of any team. 

My team only has six members, but even with few people, a project can easily become confusing. Multiple people might be working on the same task but separately or some might need to build on someone else’s previous work. In such a situation, SCM decreases confusion, and the team can cut down on time required to complete the project. There’s also the necessary communication between customers and the developing team. The team has to know the end goals before they can start working, and sometimes project goals can change. For example, the deadline might be moved or the customer has a new priority. Whatever the case, requirements must be cleanly communicated, organized, and grouped. The roles of the SCM process might be hard to actualize for this class project, but a clearer structure and process for approval of changes will increase the efficiency of any project. With consistent rules for all decisions, the project as a whole becomes more consistent.
